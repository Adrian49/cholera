Description: Amends errors, augments data and aids analysis of John Snow's map
    of the 1854 London cholera outbreak. The original data come from

    data, <http://www.ncgia.ucsb.edu/pubs/snow/snow.html>, are no longer
    available. However, they have been preserved in the HistData R package,
    <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HistData>.
