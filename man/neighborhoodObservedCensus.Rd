\title{Summary statistics for observed walking neighborhoods.}
\usage{
neighborhoodObservedCensus(pump.select = NULL, vestry = FALSE,
  weighted = TRUE, statistic = "address")
}
\arguments{
\item{pump.select}{Numeric. Default is NULL; all pumps are used. Otherwise, pump.select is a vector of numeric IDs that ranges from 1 to 13 for \code{pumps} or 1 to 14 for \code{pumps.vestry}. This determines which pumps are used to compute neighborhoods.}

\item{vestry}{Logical. TRUE uses the 14 pumps from the Vestry Report. FALSE uses the 13 in the original map.}

\item{weighted}{Logical. TRUE uses shortest path weighted by road distance.}

\item{statistic}{Character. "address" uses the count of address at pumps' locations. "fatality" plots the total count of fatality at pumps' locations.}
}
\value{
A data frame.
}
\description{
Neighborhoods are based on the shortest paths between a fatality's address and its nearest pump.
