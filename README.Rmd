### cholera: amend, augment and aid analysis of John Snow's 1854 cholera data

John Snow's map of the 1854 Soho, London cholera outbreak is one of the best known examples of data visualization and information design:

![](vignettes/msu-snows-mapB.jpg)

The "textbook" account is that Snow used the map to show that cholera was a waterborne not airborne disease, to identify the water pump on Broad Street as the source of the disease, and to convince officials to remove pump's handle thereby stemming the tide of the outbreak. Little of this stands up to careful scrutiny. The greater puzzle is why despite the evidence (and the map), Snow failed to convince both local officials and his peers in the scientific community of the validity of his claims, and why we hold the map in such high regard today. To address these questions, this package helps users assess and explore the map and its data.

### pump neighborhoods

The starting point to understanding what Snow hoped to achieve with his map lies with the second and lesser-known version of the map, which appeared in the official report on the outbreak:

![](vignettes/fig12-6.png)

What makes this second version important is the addition of a graphical annotation that describes the Broad Street pump "neighborhood": the residences that were most likely to use the pump that Snow suspected as being the source of the outbreak. Because getting drinking water in 1854 London meant physically fetching it from a public pump, the notion of a "neighborhood" is pivotal to Snow's claim that cholera is a waterborne disease. If he was right, the outbreak should literally stop at the neighborhood's borders.

While the details of how Snow "computed" his annotation are lost to history, this package offers a variety of ways, besides Snow's effort, to compute pump neighborhoods.

The two more systematic methods compute the neighborhoods for all selected pumps. The first uses Voronoi tessellation. It is based on the Euclidean distance between pumps:

```{r voronoi, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, message = FALSE}
library(cholera)
plot(neighborhoodVoronoi())
```

While a popular and easy to compute choice, the drawback is that it assumes that people can walk through walls: Euclidean distance is distance "as-the-crow-flies". The more accurate but hard to compute choice is to compute the actual walking distances along the streets of Soho.

This appears, in fact, to be the method that Snow used. He writes that the annotation includes "the various points which have been found by careful measurement to be at an equal distance by the nearest road from the pump in Broad Street and the surrounding pumps". To reconstruct and extend his efforts, I transform the roads into a "social" network. By doing this, computing walking distances becomes a graph theory problem. I compute the shortest path between a given case (observed or simulated) and its nearest pump:

```{r path, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, message = FALSE}
walkingPath(150)
```

Then, to identify the different neighborhoods, I simply (but efficiently) "rinse and repeat":

```{r walk, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, message = FALSE}
plot(neighborhoodWalking())
```

You can further explore the data by including or excluding certain pumps. This can be important because factors other than distance may play a role in the choice of pump. For example, Snow argues that water from the pump on Little Marlborough Street pump (#6) was of low quality and that people in that neighborhood actually preferred the water from the Broad Street pump (#7). To investigate this possibility, you can simply exclude the pump on Little Marlborough Street:

```{r walk6, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, message = FALSE}
plot(neighborhoodWalking(-6))
```

### getting started

To install "cholera", use the expression below. Note that you need to have already installed the "devtools" R package.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lindbrook/cholera", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Besides the help pages, the vignettes include detailed discussion about the data and functions included in this package.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette("duplicate.missing.cases")
vignette("unstacking.fatalities")
vignette("pump.neighborhoods")
vignette("roads")
vignette("time.series")
```
